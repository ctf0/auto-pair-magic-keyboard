# Auto pair (Apple Magic keyboard 2) for windows & mac

am using a usb hub to watch its connection status and based on that i connect/disconnect the keyboard.
however the triggers can still be executed manually for both `win & mac`


# Mac:
- install https://folivora.ai/
- install https://github.com/toy/blueutil
- add 2 triggers to BTT for when usb hub is connected/disconnected
- {{shell scripts here}}
- now we have automated the (pair/unpair & connection) on mac

# Win:
- install https://bluetoothinstaller.com/bluetooth-command-line-tools
- use `btdiscovery -s` to get (service UUID & MAC_ADD)
- create 2 batch files with the cmnds to pair/unpair the keyboard
- {{batch files here + watcher script}}

- run on login via Task Scheduler
	- Open Task Scheduler
	- Create Basic Task :
		Name: USB Watcher
		Trigger: When I log on
		Action: Start a Program
		Program/script: `powershell.exe`
		Add arguments: `-WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\usb_watcher.ps1"`
	- Finish, then open the task properties:
		- Go to the General tab
			- Check `Run with highest privileges`
			- Set Configure for to your OS version (e.g., Windows 10 or 11)
			- Optionally change the user account if needed
		- In the Settings tab, make sure:
			- "Allow task to be run on demand" is enable
			- "Stop the task if it runs longer than..." â†’ unchecked (or extended)
